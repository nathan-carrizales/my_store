My Store
-------------
# Overview:
This repository aims at the folowing:
1) building a database in MySQL using a CSV of publicly available sale data found at Kaggle.
2) gaining analytic insight into the data using SQL queries.
3) writing a report in Tableau that visualizes KPI's. 

Additionally, Python is used to aid data cleaning and insert data into the database.


# The Data:
The csv data ("global_superstore.csv") is available to download courtesey of [Apoorva Mahalingappa](https://www.kaggle.com/apoorvaappz) on Kaggle through this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/apoorvaappz/global-super-store-dataset). This dataset contains ~50,000 individual sales, where each sale contains information about the product, customer, location, profit, and quantity among other things.


# The Database:
Three tables were choosen based off of the principles of normalization: `customer`, `sale`, `product`. Together, they make up the database (schema) called `mystore`. Here is a entity-relationship model visualizing the structure of the database:
